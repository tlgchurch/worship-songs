Verse 1
Who compares to You
Who set the stars in their place
You who calmed the raging seas
That came crashing over me

Verse 2
Who compares to You
You who bring the morning light
The hope of all the earth
Is rest assured in Your great love

CHORUS
You are magnificent
Eternally wonderful
Glorious
Jesus
No one ever will compare
To You Jesus

Verse 3
Where the evening fades
You call forth songs of joy
As the morning wakes
We Your children give You praise

CHORUS
You are magnificent
Eternally wonderful
Glorious
Jesus
No one ever will compare
To You Jesus
