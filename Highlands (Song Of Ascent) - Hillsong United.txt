VERSE 1
O how high would I climb mountains 
If the mountains were where You hide
O how far I’d scale the valleys
If You graced the other side

VERSE 2
O how long have I chased rivers
From lowly seas to where they rise
Against the rush of grace descending
From the source of its supply

PRE-CHORUS 1
In the highlands and the heartache 
You’re neither more or less inclined
I would search and stop at nothing 
You’re just not that hard to find

CHORUS
So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise You when the mountain’s in my way
You’re the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same

No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray 
You’re the heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same

VERSE 3
O how far beneath Your glory
Does Your kindness extend the path
From where Your feet rest on the sunrise
To where You sweep the sinner’s past

VERSE 4
O how fast would You come running
If just to shadow me through the night
Trace my steps through all my failure
And walk me out the other side 

PRE-CHORUS 2
For who could dare ascend that mountain
That valleyed hill called Calvary
But for the One I call Good Shepherd 
Who like a lamb was slain for me

CHORUS
So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise You when the mountain’s in my way
You’re the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same

No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray 
You’re the heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same

BRIDGE (2x)
Whatever I walk through
Wherever I am
Your Name can move mountains
Wherever I stand

And if ever I walk through
The valley of death
I’ll sing through the shadows
My song of ascent

PRE-CHORUS 3
From the gravest of all valleys
Come the pastures we call grace
A mighty river flowing upwards
From a deep but empty grave

CHORUS
So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise You when the mountain’s in my way
You’re the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same

No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray 
You’re the heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same
