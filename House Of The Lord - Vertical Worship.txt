We worship the God who was, we worship the God who is
We worship the God who evermore will be
He opened the prison doors, He parted the raging sea
My God, he holds the victory, yeah

CHORUS 1
There's joy in the house of the Lord
There's joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won't be quiet, we shout out Your praise
There's joy in the house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this place and we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

VERSE 2
We sing to the God who heals, we sing to the God who saves
We sing to the God who always makes a way
'Cause He hung upon that cross, then He rose up from that grave
My God's still rolling stones away, yeah

There's joy in the house of the Lord
There's joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won't be quiet, we shout out Your praise
There's joy in the house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this place and we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

We were the pris'ners, now we're running free
We are forgiven, accepted, redeemed by His grace
So let the house of the Lord sing praise
