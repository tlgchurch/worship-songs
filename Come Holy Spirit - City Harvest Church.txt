VERSE
Come Holy Spirit
Fall on me now
I need Your anointing
Come in Your power
I love You Holy Spirit
You're captivating my soul
And everyday I grow to love You more

CHORUS
I'm reaching for Your heart
You hold my life into Your hands
Drawing me closer to You
I feel Your power renew
Nothing compares to this place
Where I can see You face to face
I worship You in spirit and in truth
