O Holy Night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Saviour’s birth!

Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appear'd and the soul felt its worth.

A thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

CHORUS
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night, Oh night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace

Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy name 

CHORUS
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night, Oh night divine

CHORUS
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night, Oh night divine
