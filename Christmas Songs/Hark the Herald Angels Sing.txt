VERSE 1
Hark! the herald angels sing,
Glory to the newborn King!
Peace on earth and mercy mild

God and sinners reconciled"
Joyful, all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies

With angelic hosts proclaim,
Christ is born in Bethlehem

Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King!

VERSE 2
Christ by highest Heav'n adored
Christ the everlasting Lord!
Late in time behold Him come

Offspring of a Virgin's womb
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail the incarnate Deity

Pleased with us in flesh to dwell,
Jesus, our Emmanuel
Hark! the herald angels sing,
Glory to the newborn King!

VERSE 3
Hail the Heav'n-born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Son of Righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings
Ris'n with healing in His wings

Mild He lays His glory by
Born that we no more may die,
Born to raise us from the earth,

Born to give us second birth
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King!
