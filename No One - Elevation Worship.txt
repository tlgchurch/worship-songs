[Bridge]
Who else can lead us, lead us to freedom
(No one, no one, no one)
Who else can heal all our sins and diseases
(No one, no one, no one)
Who else can walk, walk on the water
(No one, no one, no one)
And who else can answer, answer by fire
(No one, no one, no one)
And who else can bring down the tallest of giants
(No one, no one, no one)
And who else can silence the roar of the lion
(No one, no one, no one)
And who else is worthy, worthy of worship
(No one, no one, no one)
Who else is worthy, worthy of worship
(No one, no one, no one)
