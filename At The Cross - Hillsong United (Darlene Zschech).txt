VERSE 1
Oh Lord You've searched me
You know my way
Even when I fail You
I know You love me

VERSE 2
Your holy presence
Surrounding me
In every season
I know You love me,
I know You love me

CHORUS
At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this,
You have overcome the grave
Your glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now

VERSE 3
You go before me
You shield my way
Your hand upholds me
I know You love me

CHORUS (2x)
At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this,
You have overcome the grave
Your glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now

BRIDGE (2x)
You tore the veil
You made a way
When You said that it is done

VERSE 4
And when the earth fades
Falls from my eyes,
And You stand before me
I know You love me,
I know You love me

CHORUS (2x)
At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this,
You have overcome the grave
Your glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now

BRIDGE (4x)
You tore the veil
You made a way
When You said that it is done
