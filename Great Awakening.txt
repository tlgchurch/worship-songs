VERSE 1
Lord, pour out Your Spirit
On all the peoples of the earth
Let Your sons and daughters
Speak Your words of prophesy
Send us dreams and visions
Reveal the secret of Your heart
Lord our faith is rising
Let all heaven sound the coming of Your day

CHORUS
There's gonna be a great awakening
There's gonna be a great revival in our
land
There's gonna be a great awakening
And everyone who calls on Jesus
They will be saved

VERSE 2
Lord, pour out Your Spirit
On all the nations of the world
Let them see Your glory
Let them fall in reverent awe
Show Your mighty power
Shake the heavens and the earth
Lord, the world is waiting
Let creation see the coming of Your day

CHORUS (4x)
There's gonna be a great awakening
There's gonna be a great revival in our land
There's gonna be a great awakening
And everyone who calls on Jesus
They will be saved
