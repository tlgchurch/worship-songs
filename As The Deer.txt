Chorus 1
You alone are my strength my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship Thee

Verse 1
As the deer panteth for the water
So my soul longeth after Thee
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship Thee

Verse 2
You're my friend
And You are my brother
Even though You are a King
I love You more than any other
So much more than anything

Verse 3
I want You more than gold
Or silver
Only You can satisfy
You alone are the real joygiver
And the apple of my eye
