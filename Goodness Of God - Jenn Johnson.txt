VERSE 1
I love You Lord
Oh Your mercy never fails me
All my days
I’ve been held in Your hands
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
I will sing of the goodness of God

CHORUS
All my life You have been faithful
All my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
I will sing of the goodness of God

VERSE 2
I love Your voice
You have led me through the fire
In darkest nights
You are close like no other

I’ve known You as a father
I’ve known You as a friend
I have lived in the goodness of God


CHORUS
All my life You have been faithful
All my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
I will sing of the goodness of God

Bridge (2x)
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me
With my life laid down, I’m surrendered now, I give You everything
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me

CHORUS
All my life You have been faithful
All my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
I will sing of the goodness of God
