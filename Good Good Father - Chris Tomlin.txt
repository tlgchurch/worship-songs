VERSE 1
Oh, I've heard a thousand stories of what they think You're like
But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night
And You tell me that You're pleased
And that I'm never alone

CHORUS
You're a Good, Good Father
It's who You are, It's who You are, It's who You are
And I'm loved by You
It's who I am, It's who I am, It's who I am

VERSE 2
Oh, I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
But I've known we're all searching
For answers only You provide
Cause You know just what we need
Before we say a word

CHORUS (2x)
You're a Good, Good Father
It's who You are, It's who You are, It's who You are
And I'm loved by You
It's who I am, It's who I am, It's who I am

BRIDGE
Cause' You are perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways to us,
You are perfect in all of Your ways
Oh, You're perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways to us

VERSE 3
Oh, it's love so undeniable
I, I can hardly speak
Peace so unexplainable
I, I can hardly think
As You call me deeper still
As You call me deeper still
As You call me deeper still
Into love, love, love

CHORUS (3x)
You're a Good, Good Father
It's who You are, It's who You are, It's who You are
And I'm loved by You
It's who I am, It's who I am, It's who I am

BRIDGE 1
Cause' You are perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways
To us

BRIDGE 2
You are perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways
You are perfect in all of Your ways
To us

CHORUS
You're a Good, Good Father
It's who You are, It's who You are, It's who You are
And I'm loved by You
It's who I am, It's who I am, It's who I am
