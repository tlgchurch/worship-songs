VERSE 1
You’re turning over tables
And calling for return
To our lives upon the altar
The things we did at first
You’re clearing out the temple
You’re cleaning out the dirt
For we are Your territory
Lord we are Your Church

CHORUS
We are Your people
You are our God
We are Your temple
Make us holy like You are

VERSE 2
You see a holy nation
A flock to consecrate
A chosen generation
A people called to pray
So help us God to please You
Where only You can see
For every moment matters in eternity

CHORUS 2
We are Your people
You are our God
We are Your temple
Make us holy like You are

We are Your children
You’ve set us apart
God for Your glory
Make us holy like You are

BRIDGE 1
Mark Your people with Your presence
Make us a place where You delight to dwell
May we heed Your hand’s correction
Oh Lord our Shepherd
You do all things well

Your love as firm as it is tender
Your law is perfect
And Your judgments true
As we run to resurrender
You will restore what we return to You
You are restoring as we yield anew

CHORUS 2
We are Your people
You are our God
We are Your temple
Make us holy like You are

We are Your children
You’ve set us apart
God for Your glory
Make us holy like You are

BRIDGE 2 (5x)
If You’re calling
We’re coming
We’re not walking
We’re running
God we need resurrender
We resurrender

So We resurrender

CHORUS 2
We are Your people
You are our God
We are Your temple
Make us holy like You are

We are Your children
You’ve set us apart
God for Your glory
Make us holy like You are

BRIDGE 2 (2x)
If You’re calling
We’re coming
We’re not walking
We’re running
God we need resurrender
We resurrender
